This is Haosong Liu, a recent grad in ECE from University of Miami. I'm a big fan of Japanese Animie and Classical Music.

I'm passionate about Software Engineering in general with a particular interest in Cloud Computing.

Although I have experience doing front-end development, it always pains me to actually design the layout of those pages. Thus, I'm more into the backend world.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haosong-liu-512bb0126/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/E-Coli-BW)

*(Possibly) interesting side note: The username of my GitHub account comes from a strain of bacteria used in my junior year's research on active fluid. It was through that summer's research experience that I fell in love with programming and decided to swtich gear to pursue a Master degree in Computer Engineering.
