First time ever setting up personal blog for showcasing my resume. Also serve as a public "notebook" to let me jot down some random stuff (process of setting up environment, some weird bugs I encountered, some random thoughts, material science jokes etc).

At the moment, I'm still a newbie to jekyll. Took me a whole lot of effort to just tweak the site a little bit. Although right now, it's good enough for me. I got the site up and running. Can do some simple blogging, can showcase my resume and that's pretty much everything I need for now.

I will keep learning jekyll in hope to add some customize features to my site. The most urgent one right now is to add clickable tags for each blog and a tag cloud on the index page. So far, I still cannot figure out how to do that even after following a blogger's tutorial. Guess it's because I'm still quite confused about the overall structure of jekyll. It is very elegant and easy to use, but at the moment, I find it also emposes a lot of weird overhead and the documentation sometimes a bit confusing.

But anyway, I will keep researching about this and try to really master it to make my site a easy to use static blog for myself.
