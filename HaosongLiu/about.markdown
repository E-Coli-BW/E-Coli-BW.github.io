I'm Haosong Liu, B.S in Material Science and Engineering from University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Miami. I'm interested in software engineering in general with an interest in cloud computing in particular. I belive it is the era of cloud computing now or in the near future.

Over the years, I find memories quite unreliable. Things quickly got faded away like a single electron spinning on the outermost orbital of an atom gets dragged away by some external force.

This is a blog website for me to note done some thoughts I might have from time to time. Sharing my knowledge and thoughts to the public while serving as a memo for me at the same time.

You can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haosong-liu-512bb0126/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/E-Coli-BW) or email me at [louisliu960115@gmail.com](louisliu960115@gmail.com) if you are outside GFW or at [lhs960115@126.com](lhs960115@126.com) if you are insdie GFW without VPN.

(possibly) interesting side-note: My GitHub account was registered when I was still an undergrad studying Material Science and my username E-Coli-BW is actually the strain name of the bacteria I used for doing active fluid experiements in the lab I worked for as an undergrad researcher at UMN.
